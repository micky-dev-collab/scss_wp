# SCSS Framework for Custom WordPress Development

This repository contains a **lightweight and modular SCSS framework** designed to streamline the development of custom WordPress themes.  
It provides a foundational style library that promotes **code consistency, reusability, and easy maintenance** across multiple projects.

---

## 🌟 Features

- **Variables**  
  A centralized file (`_variables.scss`) for managing global styles like colors, typography, and spacing.

- **Mixins**  
  A collection of reusable code blocks (`_mixins.scss`) to handle repetitive tasks and complex layouts, such as vendor prefixes and flexbox grids.

- **Components**  
  Modular, self-contained SCSS partials for common UI elements like buttons, cards, and navigation menus.

- **Layouts**  
  A dedicated folder for organizing the structural styles of your site's header, footer, and grid system.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To use this framework in your custom WordPress theme, follow these simple steps:

### 1. Clone or Copy the Repository
```bash
# Option 1: Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/micky-dev-collab/scss_wp.git

# Option 2: Copy only the SCSS folder
cp -r my-scss-framework/scss /path/to/your/theme/assets/
````

### 2. Set Up SCSS Compilation

Set up a build tool (like **Sass, Gulp, or Webpack**) to compile your SCSS into a single CSS file.

If using the command-line Sass compiler, navigate to your theme's `assets/` directory and run:

```bash
sass --watch scss/style.scss:../style.css
```

### 3. Import Partials into `style.scss`

In your main `style.scss`, import the partials to make variables, mixins, and components available:

```scss
// style.scss
@import 'base/variables';
@import 'base/mixins';
@import 'base/typography';
@import 'layouts/header';
@import 'components/buttons';
// ... import other files as needed
```

### 4. Add WordPress Theme Header

At the top of your compiled `style.css`, include the WordPress theme header as required.
